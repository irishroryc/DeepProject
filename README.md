# DeepProject
Repository for work on Deep Learning project

Ben Hwang and I used the files in this repository to create novel music with Generative Adversarial Networks by training on a set of visual representations of classical songs from the MAESTRO data set.

Examples of the images we trained on and created can be found in the img directory, and some of our music samples are available in the songs directory.
